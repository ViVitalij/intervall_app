# IntervalApp #

### What is an IntervalApp? ###

IntervalApp is an application designed for both physically active users and users who want to start
their running adventure. The program has 3 integrated running modules, giving you the option of
"quick start". Importantly, the user has the ability to manually add modes that are tailored to his
individual needs. By integrating the application with the Android platform's audio system,
the runner has an impact on what music he hears at his chosen interval and is given the opportunity
to create his own base tracks for a particular type of effort. For people who are actively engaged in
interval drills, changing the track according to the pace of the race also solves the problem of
time tracking in a given mode. By using the Realm object database, you gain the ability to monitor
your own progress. By integrating applications with Firebase APIs, you get the ability to
personalize your application and create your own unique account. Modern design, designed using
Material Design, in line with the latest mobile application development standards, makes the
application intuitive and user-friendly during the exercise.
